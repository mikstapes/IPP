### IPP - Independent Point Projection ###
A tool for comparative genomics beyond sequence alignments


-----------------
## METHOD SUMMARY
-----------------

For a genomic region with conserved synteny, any non-alignable coordinate can be approximately projected from one genome to another by linear interpolation of its relative position between two alignable anchor points.
The accuracy of such interpolations negatively correlates with the distance to the anchor points. Therefore, projections between species with large evolutionary distances (e.g. > 200 my) tend to be inaccurate due to a low anchor point density. Including so-called bridging species may increase the anchor point density and thus improve projection accuracy.
The optimal choice and combination of bridging species may vary from one genomic location to another. This presents a shortest path problem in a graph where every node is a species and the weighted edges between nodes represent distances of genomic locations to their anchor points (|x - a|). We established a scoring function that exponentially decreases with increasing distances |x - a|. The shortest path problem is solved using Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959).

## USAGE ##
-----------

download_ipp_data:
	IPP uses a collection of pairwise alignments between the reference, target, and all bridging species stored in binary format.
	These are large files stored separately from github and can be downloaded using this script.

compute_alignments:
	Use the scripts in this folder to compute pairwise alignments for your own set of species.
	A Snakefile guides through the whole alignment process from fasta to chain file and creates the final collection of pairwise alignments between reference, target and all bridging species.

project.py:
	Project the regions of a bed-file from one genome to another.
	Type project.py -h for a detailed description.
